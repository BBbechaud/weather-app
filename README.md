# weather-app

This project is a weather app that displays weather data for a desired city/location.

Features include: using an API to search and gather various weather data for the desired location, a background image that changes based on the local time of the city, and an text animation with CSS keyframes.

How to use: Simply enter your desired city and the API will fetch the location displaying the local time, current conditions, current temparature and feel, humidity, and wind speed. An error message will also be displayed if the input is invalid.

This weather app was my first "heavy" javascript project for me and I wanted to add some different features to try to make it stand out more than the typical weather app. Building this project really helped me better understand API's and how async code works. It also helped me write more complex functions with different JS methods I never used before. This was also the first time using CSS keyframes on a project. Things I could've done better are displaying more data, and having it run smoother as it feels a little clunky at times.
